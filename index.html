        <h1>Indiana Jones</h1>
        <img src="img/Indy.jpg">
        <p>To put it simply, Indiana Jones is the man. He runs around to the most incredible places in the world whoopin on bad guys with a whip, which is the coolest weapon. Who wouldn't want to do that? He is also one of the elite few who can rock a fedora. No small feat. Finally, he has encounters with all sorts of crazy artifacts. Indiana Jones is awesome.</p>
        <p>He appears in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971/">The Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></p>
